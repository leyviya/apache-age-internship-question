#Â Fibonacci sequence using Dynamic Programming

This program implements the Fibonacci sequence using Dynamic Programming in C. It uses a custom Node structure to represent different arithmetic operations and conditions, and evaluates their values recursively using the calc function.

Installation

To run this program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system, such as gcc. If you don't have one, you can download it from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can compile the program using the following command:

Copy code
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
This will generate an executable file named fibonacci. You can then run the program by typing:

bash
Copy code
./fibonacci
Usage
The program is designed to calculate the Fibonacci sequence for a given number using the arithmetic operations +, -, * and /. You can modify the input values in the main function to calculate the sequence for different numbers, as shown in the example code.

The program will output the results of each arithmetic operation and the final Fibonacci value.
